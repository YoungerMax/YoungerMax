Hey! It's great to (digitally) meet you. Here's a few facts about me:

- I was born on September 15, 2007 in Boston, MA.
- I'm currently a senior in high school. I'll be heading to college this coming fall, but I don't know where yet.
- I've been tinkering and coding since May 3, 2015, but before that I was building with redstone and command blocks in Minecraft.
- I don't vacation much, but when I do, it's usually to Walt Disney World. [Here's a funny picture of me in the Magic Kingdom as a kid.](https://lincolnmaxwell.com/static/posts/about-me/mk.jpg)
- Besides coding and creating, I enjoy reading, writing, ice skating, and conversing. I'm currently reading *How To Know A Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen* by David Brooks.
- I'm not a fan of islands. Regardless, [here's a more recent picture of me at a vista on Saint Kitts' and Nevis.](https://lincolnmaxwell.com/static/posts/about-me/profile.jpg)
- I'm very family oriented. Much of my time besides school, coding, reading, and my other hobbies is spent talking with my family members.
